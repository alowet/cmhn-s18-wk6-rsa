Feedback:

Ex 4: Are you sure you can read that from the data? I would say it is pretty messy since it is just one participant. It is much clearer in the RDM of Ex 5.  
Ex 8: I wanted you to report the appropriate dimensionality of the data according to the stress plot but I admit that wasn't clear from the question.  
Ex 10: Correct! Smart approach to look at the mean activity. Also very clear working.  
N: Nice work
